<p>This text documents how I implemented the comments made by Dr. Roos
on the {ERforResearch}-package, implementing the Bayesian Ranking. I
also discuss and explain whenever I did not implement one of her points.
Dr. Roos comments are in in italic.</p>
<p>[23.01.2023] Note that in the meantime, I also switched from
<code>rjags</code> to <code>runjags</code> (since ERforResearch_4.0.0).
Hence I updated parts of the text to take this change into account
too.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="package-erforresearch">Package: ERforResearch<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#package-erforresearch"></a>
</h2>
<p><em>The software used for computations in the manuscript is freely
accessible online. The package ERforResearch_2.0.0 can be easily
downloaded from GitHub <a href="https://github.com/snsf-data/ERforResearch" class="external-link uri">https://github.com/snsf-data/ERforResearch</a> and installed
on a computer. Please discuss whether you want to keep ER in the name of
this package. You frequently use the notion of Bayesian ranking (BR), so
that your package could also be called BRforResearch instead of
ERforResearch. The supplement <a href="https://snsf-data.github.io/ERpaper-online-supplement/" class="external-link uri">https://snsf-data.github.io/ERpaper-online-supplement/</a>
could be improved in several ways to better demonstrate the
reproducibility of the results:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Currently, the code for some of the plots is
missing.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Some chunks of the code copy-pasted code produce an error,
because the function here() is missing.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Although the rankability is not discussed in detail in the
manuscript, it is used in the online supplement.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>The simulation study is not provided in the
supplement.</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reply:</strong> I am very happy to read, that the
installation of the package is straightforward. Dr. Roos raises a good
point when suggesting to change the name to BRforResearch, which I
considered. However, I feel like changing the name at this stage of the
project might be to big of a hazzle. The publication referencing the
package is already published as a preprint, and the paper submission is
already quite far.</p>
<p>The online supplement of the paper was updated accordingly. The code
for all the plots can be looked at. The problem with the here() function
has been resolved, as the dependency of ERforResearch on the package
{here} has been removed. The rankability is still present in the
supplement, as it is implemented in the package. However, as rankability
is not discussed in the paper, I will add a reference to Lingsma (2009)
in the documentation of the function. Otherwise, it will appear a bit
arbitrary to the user. The simulation study is still not provided. The
code for the simulated data is provided in the appendix of the
manuscript, and for now, I judged that enough. However, yes, the
simulation study part is therefore not reproducible.</p>

<h2 id="function-get_default_jags_model">Function: get_default_jags_model()<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#function-get_default_jags_model"></a>
</h2>
<p><em>This function is well implemented. It gives a convenient access
to the four models obtained by crossing continuous/ordinal likelihoods
with homogeneous/heterogeneous variances. This function writes the code
for JAGS to the default_jags_model.txt file. Although this file can
contain the continuous/homogeneous model, it can also contain three
other models. Remarks:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>The connection between the four models provided by this
function and the models discussed in the main manuscript is unclear. In
particular, the JAGS code provided in the appendix of the main
manuscript does not fit any of these models.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>JAGS models cannot provide posteriors for the parameter
overall_mean. Instead, this parameter (called ψ or μ in the main
manuscript) is fixed at the overall mean of grades. Please explain this
issue in the main manuscript.</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reply:</strong> Regarding the first remark, the JAGS code in
the appendix, has been changed as to being the same as the one
implemented in the functions in ERforResearch. Also the second remark
has been implemented. It should be clear now, from the model definition
that the overall_mean is not a model parameter that has to be estimated
but it is simply a summary of the data.</p>
<p>In addition, I added the model that allows for different
sub-panels/sections to be merged as a default model option. The
parameter subpanels was added as a Boolean variable (default is
FALSE).</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="function-get_mcmc_samples">Function: get_mcmc_samples()<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#function-get_mcmc_samples"></a>
</h2>
<p><em>This function is well implemented. However, it uses only 2
chains, provides values of chains that are not fully reproducible, and
uses an outdated criterion for . Therefore, its functionality could be
improved in several ways.</em></p>
<p><em>Remarks for the manual:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>The value of this function is a list.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>The example does not explicitly state path_to_jags_model. In
this situation, it is unclear what a default model means. I assume that
the default model is a continuous/homogeneous model. For a potential
user, one could provide an additional example, where a non-default model
is used.</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Remarks for the implementation:</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><em>JAGS provides 4 different random number generators to
challenge the convergence of MCMC chains. To specify reproducible MCMC
chains in JAGS, one needs explicit starting values of parameters,
explicit values of random number generators, and separate seed values.
One example of how to initiate these 4 chains in a fully reproducible
way in JAGS is provided in the file
review_ERforResearch_R_code.R.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Because puts the within-chain and the between-chain
variability in relation to each other, the convergence of MCMC chains
can be better assessed if there are 4 different chains available for
computation of .</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>The value 1.1 of the threshold applied to to assess the
convergence of MCMC chains is outdated. It has been shown that a lower
threshold is necessary to yield reasonable estimates of target
quantities (Vats and Knudson, 2021; Vehtari et al., 2021)</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>It is not the number of iterations in MCMC chains that
informs about the quality of posteriors but the effective sample size
(ESS). This means that Table 6 provided in the appendix of the main
manuscript is not helpful for the user without any ESS values. Note that
the ESS diagnostic proposed by Vats and Knudson (2021) is available for
public use in the R package stableGR.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Alternatively, to trace plots one could use rank plots
Vehtari et al. (2021). See also mcmc_rank_hist function provided in the
package bayesplot Gabry et al. (2019).</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>I am not convinced that uniform priors U(0,2] for precisions
are optimal. In the main manuscript, you refer to Gelman (2006) to
justify this choice. Why? In my opinion, both Gelman (2006) and Gelman
and Hill (2007) warn that uniform priors can cause unexpected
posteriors. Note also that Ott et al. (2021) demonstrated that
truncation imposed by a uniform prior can have an unpleasant impact on
the in formativeness of posteriors.</em></p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>All 4 models implemented in the ERforResearch package are
challenging. Therefore, prior assumptions can be crucial for the
inference. In the long term, please consider the use of other priors for
the heterogeneity parameter, so that the sensitivity of ER estimates to
prior assumptions can be assessed. Alternatively, you could elicit
optimistic and sceptical priors for hyperparameters.</em></p>
<p><strong>Reply:</strong> Regarding the remarks for the manual, I
updated the documentation of the function, saying that the output is a
list. Also the example will be updated.</p>
<p>Next I’ll go through each of the implementation points:</p>
<ul>
<li><ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>and 2.: I changed the default of two to four chains for the
samplers. Therefore, the function name
get_inits_overdispersed_tow_chains changed to
get_inits_overdispersed_four_chains, with also the four different
samplers in the initialization list. The reproduciblitly of the code was
ensured by following the script provided with the review: For all
default models the initial values were set (if overdispersed) or
randomly selected based on the seed, and then fed into the sampling
algorithm.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>3.: As suggested in recent literature (Vats and Knudson, 2021;
Vehtari et al., 2021), I changed the threshold applied to to 1.01. The
optimization loop was updated using <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/runjags/man/run.jags.html" class="external-link">runjags::extend.jags()</a></code>.
It is important to give the function a <code>max.iter</code> parameter
value that is not too high, the default is set to 1’000’000. Otherwise,
it will run forever.</p></li>
<li><p>4.: The runjags-package provides effective sample sizes as well
as Monte Carlo error.</p></li>
<li><p>5.: The rank histograms are available from the
<code>bayesplot</code> package. This graphical representation was added
in the vignette.</p></li>
<li><p>6.: TBA</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the tests performed in the package on this function
were extended: all possible combinations of the default model generation
as now tested. Therefore, the testing also takes longer.</p>
<p>Also the vignette needed to be updated in general.</p>

<h2 id="function-get_er_from-jags">Function: get_er_from jags<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#function-get_er_from-jags"></a>
</h2>
<p><em>This function computes ER estimates either for an object provided
for mcmc_samples or for an object obtained from running the
get_mcmc_samples function again.</em></p>
<p><em>Remarks for the manual:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Describe the meaning of the variables: avg_grade, er,
rank_pm, and pcer.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Show an example when this function is applied to the
mcmc_samples object.</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Remarks for the function:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>This function is based on the rankability although this
notion is no more used in the revised manuscript.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Please keep in mind that the values of different ICC are not
comparable across different settings.</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reply:</strong> Regarding the remarks on the documentation:
The return object of the function is explained in detail and an example
where an mcmc_samples object was provided is added. Regarding the
function itself: all mentioning and computation of the rankability is
deleted from the package, as this might be confusing. The comment on ICC
is relevant mainly for the paper as they are not computed by and in the
package.</p>
